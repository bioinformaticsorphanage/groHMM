Version 2.0.6 -- Date:6-6-12
-- Meta-Gene (and most windowing functions) should now work with strand -- CAUTION: IT'S STILL UNTESTED!!
-- Added a (non-optional) pseudocount of 1 read to gene body in pausing index calculation.
-- PausingIndex function now returns counts used to calculate Fisher's exact (as well as Fisher's Exact).
-- A few bugfixes.

Version 2.0.5 -- Date:24-4-12
-- Added a calculation of confidence intervals (assuming a Poisson random variable) to pausing index measurements.

Version 2.0.4 -- Date:11-3-11
-- Changed PDF function wrappers to include an arbitrary number of arguments.  This will make it compatable with the 4 parameter a*norm+(1-a)*expr.
-- Implemented: a*norm+(1-a)*expr emission model.  Fit using conjugate gradient method.
-- Implemented compatability for missing data in emissions (EXCEPT for a*NORM+(1-a)*EXP).  These should be set to NaN in R and all emissions distributions will return 0.

Version 2.0.3 -- Date:8-18-11
-- Added vect2bed() function in DecayAlgorithm.cpp that generalizes getTranscriptPositions().  getTranscriptPositions() remains, but carries a depricated tag.
-- Fixed a number of VERY important indexing bugs when using multiple sets of emissions.

Version 2.0.2 -- Date:6-13-11
-- Update HMM emissions functions to return actual probabilities of a descritised probability distribution rather values of the density function.
-- Backward algorithm bugfix.

Version 2.0.1 -- Date:5-13-11
-- Update EM source to optionally return posteriors over states.

Version 2.0.0 -- Date:5-13-11
-- Update HMM source code to support >1 set of emissions parameters.
-- Added experimental gene models that take into account reads on the + and - strand.

Version 1.0.2 -- Date:4-4-11
-- Added functions for total least squares for a line by SVD and Demming regression.
-- Added apprxoimate total least squares LOESS fit using a rough data transform approach.

Version 1.0.1 -- Date:2-7-11
-- Added GPL v.3 to each file prior to first release w/ publication of first GRO-seq papaer.

Version 1.0.0 -- Date:12-3-10
-- Added meta-gene function for data that is a continuous, real value given over positions in the genome (e.g. 
	tiling array data, or a wiggle file).

Version 0.9.9 -- Date:8-27-10
-- Added function to generate matrix of counts - rows represent streches of DNA, and columns represent
	positions relative to a feature set of interest.

Version 0.9.8 -- Date:7-30-10
-- Added to CountReadsInInterval: Optinally, p can be a two-column data.frame with columns representing chrom, 
	chromStart.  In this case strand is ignored.

Version 0.9.7 -- Date:5-8-10
-- Added R function: MetaGene_nL, which takes a meta-gene scaling all internal windows to a fixed total length.
-- Added option for UCSC header line for wiggle tracks, so that they can be uploaded without conversion to bigWig.
-- Added option to normalize read counts in WriteWiggle.
-- Added CountMappableReadsInInterval function to CountReadsInInterval.R

Version 0.9.6 -- Date:2-23-10
-- Added 'ExpressedGenes' function, which detects whether a list of genes is expressed using
	the ideas presented in Core, Waterfall, Lis; Science 2008.

Version 0.9.5 -- Date:1-26-10
-- Modified PolymeraseWave.R to use full EM, rather than Viterbi Training, for parameter estimation 
	when detecting the edge polymerase wave.

Version 0.9.1 -- Date:12-2-09
-- Added hmmEM.cpp   -> Implementatiaon of full Baum-Welch EM for an HMM.
-- Added hmmFwBk.cpp -> Implementatiaon of the forward backward algorithms.
-- Added many other functions in several files that are useful/necessary for hmm implementation.

Version 0.9.0 --Date: 11-23-09
-- Added functions for MLE estimation of gamma distribution.  Takes sufficient stats, so useful for 
	updating gamma paremeters in the context of Baum Welch.
-- Added R-wrapper to said function, useful for MLE in the R enviroment (soon to drop MASS dependency).
-- Significant cleanup for files in R directory.  Moved PolymeraseWaveStunnenberg to PolymeraseWave directory.

Version 0.8.4 --Date: 10-20-09
-- Now using Viterbi training for polymerase wave segmentation; in the context of full 3-state HMM.

Version 0.8.2 --Date: 10-10-09
-- Added function for wave segmentation by KL-divergence.

Version 0.8.0 --Date: 9-9-09
-- Integrated Andre's Viterbi implementation in HMM.c.
-- Added this CHANGELOG.
